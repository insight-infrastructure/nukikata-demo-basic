    Here is an example of the most important operator, the nukikata operator.
    It allows you to call other cookiecutters / nukikatas and therefor build
    modular / heirarchial sets of instructions. It wraps the main.cookiecutter
    function. The output of this call produces the context that was built during
    the call which is helpful in a variety of ways.
    
    Example:
    {% raw %}
    # In the templates folder you find a classic cookiecutter file structure
    local_nukikata:
      type: nukikata
      template: templates
      when: "{{ nukikata.docs_confirm }}"
      overwrite_if_exists: true {% endraw %}
   

local_nukikata:
  type: nukikata
  template: templates
  when: "{{ nukikata.local_nukikata_confirm }}"
  overwrite_if_exists: true

local_nukikata_confirm2:
  type: confirm

    It outputs a map per this output:
    {% raw %}
    {{ nuki.local_nukikata }} = {% endraw %}{{ nukikata.local_nukikata }}
    
    This is very helpful when trying to stitch together different contexts.
